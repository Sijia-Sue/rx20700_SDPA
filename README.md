This folder package contains three parts of SDPA job. The first part realizes the car rental system. Part 1 contains carRental_test.py, carshop.py, customer.py, main.py and VIP.py where the carshop.py, customer.py and VIP.py are class files. When the main function is running, you need to import the class file first.  
Part 2 analyzes the algorithm.  
Part 3 is data analytics. In this part, I used world weather API and I also put it into this folder.
